// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test.
// The most frequent task in this test is to
// find out which one of the given numbers
// differs from the others. Bob observed that
// one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
// Help Bob â€” to check his answers,
// he needs a program that among the given numbers
// finds one that is different in evenness, a
// nd return a position of this number.
//
// ! Keep in mind that your task
// is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
// which means indexes of the elements
// start from 1 (not 0)
